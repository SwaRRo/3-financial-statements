# 3-Statement Financial Modeling & Valuation Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of fully-integrated, multi-scenario 3-statement financial models built in Microsoft Excel. This project was undertaken as a comprehensive, self-guided training program to master the principles of financial modeling, forecasting, and valuation from the ground up.

Each model is built following professional best practices, including separated assumption and calculation sheets, dynamic scenario analysis, and clear, structured layouts.

## Key Features & Skills Demonstrated
*   **Dynamic 3-Statement Models:** Fully linked Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.
*   **Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis:** Models are controlled by a single dropdown to switch between "Base," "Best," and "Worst Case" scenarios, instantly updating all projections.
*   **Advanced Debt Modeling:** Integration of a dynamic Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolver") that automatically handles cash shortfalls and surpluses.
*   **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation:** A complete DCF analysis to derive the intrinsic Equity Value of a company from its projected free cash flows.
*   **Professional Best Practices:** Emphasis on clean formatting, error-checking, and building robust, auditable models.

## Portfolio of Models

This repository includes four distinct models, each designed to master a different business archetype:

### 1. SoulWheels Inc. (Manufacturing)
*   **Focus:** Modeling physical inventory (Inventory Days), PP&E roll-forwards, and core working capital dynamics. A foundational model for a traditional business.
*   `[View Model](SoulWheels_Inc_Model.xlsx)`

### 2. GamePirate Studios (Technology/SaaS)
*   **Focus:** Modeling intangible assets (Capitalized Development Costs), amortization, and the crucial liability of deferred revenue.
*   `[View Model](GamePirate_Studios.xlsx)`

### 3. Nalanda Press (Hybrid/Publishing)
*   **Focus:** Integrating multiple complex asset schedules (PP&E and Author Advances) and modeling a dynamic debt schedule with scheduled repayments.
*   `[View Model](Nalanda_Press_Model.xlsx)`

### 4. Chomp Burgers (Retail) - The Capstone Model
*   **Focus:** A complete, multi-year forecast incorporating all advanced techniques:
    *   Full Ratio Analysis dashboard, including DuPont analysis.
    *   Multi-scenario framework (Base, Best, Worst).
    *   Automated Revolving Debt Schedule.
    *   A full DCF Valuation with sensitivity analysis.

## Learning Journey & Curriculum

The skills for this portfolio were developed systematically through the following curriculum:

### Phase 1: The Unshakeable Foundation
*   Mastered core Excel mechanics including **Advanced Cell Referencing**, **Logical Functions** (`IF`, `SUMIF`), and **Professional Formatting**.

### Phase 2: The Financial Analyst's Toolkit
*   Mastered key analytical functions and tools including **`XLOOKUP`**, **Data Validation**, **`PivotTables`**, **Time Value of Money** (`PMT`, `NPV`, `IRR`), and **Sensitivity Analysis** (`Data Tables`).

### Phase 3: The Capstone - 3-Statement Modeling & Valuation
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** Built and debugged standalone financial statements to master the core accounting logic and linkages.
*   **The Gauntlet:** Achieved mechanical perfection by building integrated models for the four diverse business archetypes listed above.
*   **Advanced Techniques:** Upgraded the capstone model with the final layer of professional tools: **Scenario Analysis**, **Revolving Debt Schedules**, and **DCF Valuation**.
